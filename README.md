## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this component i tried to improve my bootstrap skills. Making spacing responsive is giving me issues when i try to override it in desktop view, starting from a web first workflow, so i was forced to use rules with !important

### Continued development

Using bootstrap components is much faster, but i feel like i'm not using it the intended way yet.
Changing spacings from a view to another is kinda tricky and i have to use !important to override everything else
I'll work more on components

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - This helps to know what features every element has, so you don't have to create it on your own
